# 🌱 AuraFarm

## 🚜 Problem Statement

India has over **145 million farmers**, yet digital adoption at the grassroots level remains low.

Current platforms:
- Treat farmers as data points, not people
- Lack farmer-to-farmer trust mechanisms
- Do not provide a unified space for sharing real farm experiences, crop practices, or peer support

AuraFarm addresses this gap by building a **farmer-centric digital ecosystem**.
